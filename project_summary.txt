Project Timeline:

1/9/2022: Start the milestone 1 -- alphabeta pruning based connected 4 player with C++. We have set up all the files.
TODO: 1) implement the board data structure, 
      2) implement the alpha_beta pruning algorithm 

2/9/2022: Finish the implementation of the board data structure for the alphabeta pruning agent
TODO: 1) test the data structure 
      2) implement the alpha_beta pruning algorithm

3/9/2022: Finish the implementation of the alpha_beta pruning agent in C++
TODO: 1) test the agent
      2) prepare the background knowledge for milestone 2

4/9/2022: Introducing transposition table to the alpha_beta pruning agent
TODO: 1) start learning MCTS + Deep Learning algorithm
      2) further test the agent 

5/9/2022: Refactor the code, seperate different players into different directory, and the common data structures into a different directory
      --> Milestone 1 ends
TODO: 1) start learning the MCTS + Deep Learning algorithm
      2) start learning socket programming for games


8/9/2022: Improve the transposition table of the alpha-beta player 
TODO: 1) start learning the MCTS + Deep Learning algorithm
      2) start learning socket programming for games


14/9/2022: Set up the CMake framework for the MCTS + Deep Learning player
