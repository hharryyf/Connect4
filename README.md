# Connect 4
Learn C++ and Deep Reinforcement Learning by writing a Connect4 player. Although alpha-beta pruning can play a game of this size very well, 
we want to use this game as an opportunity to learn how the AlphaZero algorithm works. We would firstly learn how to code a Deep Reinforcement Learning Player in Python, because it's easier, then translate it to C++.
